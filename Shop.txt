, in addition to light refreshments such as baked goods or snacks.

A café setting is known as a casual social environment where you can
 find people reading newspapers and magazines, playing board games, studying or 
chatting with others about current events.
 It is also regarded as a place where information can be exchanged.

A café is sometimes called a coffeehouse or a coffee shop or tea shop in English
, a café in French and a bar in Italian (cafe or café is the common spelling used in English
, French, Spanish, Portuguese et al. however the word is spelled "caffè" in Italian).
 It shares some characteristics of a bar and some characteristics of a restaurant given its selection o
f foods and beverages served, but is distinct from a cafeteria which is a type of restaurant 
where customers can choose from many dishes displayed on a serving line. In some countries, cafés 
are designed to more closely resemble restaurants whereby offering a range of hot meals and possibly 
licensed to serve alcohol. Most British cafés however, do not sell alcohol likely due to the prominent
 pub culture.
